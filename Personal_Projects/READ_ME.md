## 1. Global Climate Analysis
 - Global_Climate_Analysis.ipynb showcases what I am most passionate about, environmental change and recovery through use of data science. In this project, I use global climate data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), global plastics waste data, and global oil production data to determine possible sources and causes to temperature anomalies seen from the NOAA data. To perform this task, I use PCA, PCA Biplots, and linear regression models to establish temporal precedence and come to my conclusions.
